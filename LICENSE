2.1 Grant of License to Eligible Educators

If You are an Eligible Educator, then, subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright and for
so long as You remain an Eligible Educator) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below, to the
extent and only to the extent that such rights are Licensable by Licensor:

(a) to produce and reproduce the Work or any part thereof, to incorporate the Work into one or more
Collective Works, and to produce and reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

(b) to create, produce and reproduce Derivative Works;

(c) to perform publicly by means of an online or other digital video or audio transmission, or to otherwise
publicly display or publicly perform:
(i) the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works; and
(ii) Derivative Works;
in each case either: (A) as part of and only as part of a publicly offered credit or non-credit course or program
which is provided by You to the recipients of such performance or display; or (B) for any other purpose that is
approved in writing by Licensor in advance; and

(d) to distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Work to:
(i) an Eligible Student;
(ii) any Person as part of a publicly offered credit or non-credit course or program which is provided by
You to such Person; or
(iii) an Eligible Educator.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The
above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
other media and formats. The above rights include the right to provide the Work to third party contractors, on 
appropriate obligations of confidentiality, so that such third party contractors may assist You in the exercise of
the above rights. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

2.2 Eligible Educator License Restrictions

If You are an Eligible Educator, then the license granted in Section 2.1 is expressly made subject to and limited
by the following restrictions:

(a) You may distribute, perform publicly by means of an online or other digital video or audio transmission,
or otherwise publicly display or publicly perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy of the Work You
distribute, publicly perform or publicly display. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, perform publicly by means of an online or other digital video or audio
transmission, or otherwise publicly display or publicly perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License. The above applies
to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the
Original Author, as requested.

(b) You may distribute, perform publicly by means of an online or other digital video or audio transmission, or
otherwise publicly display or publicly perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and You
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy of each Derivative
Work You distribute, publicly perform or publicly display. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted
hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
You may not distribute, perform publicly by means of an online or other digital video or audio transmission,
or otherwise publicly display or publicly perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License. The above applies to
the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.

(c) If You distribute, perform publicly by means of an online or other digital video or audio transmission, or
otherwise publicly display or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You
must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work. Unless otherwise specified by the Licensor in the Work
or by notice, You must give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing
by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work
if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
(e.g., “Learning Object 3 based on original Work by Original Author”). Such credit may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

(d) From time to time at the request of Licensor or OOLC, You will provide such information as Licensor or
OOLC may reasonably request relating to Your use of the Work, and relating to the development of any
Collective Works or Derivative Works. From time to time at the request of Licensor or OOLC, You will allow
representatives of Licensor or OOLC access at reasonable hours to Your personnel and to Your systems, records
and other pertinent information, all to the extent necessary for the purpose of confirming Your compliance
with the terms of this License. OOLC is an intended third party beneficiary of this Section.

If You are an Eligible Educator and the Work contains any third party materials, then, at Your own expense,
You must obtain from the applicable third parties all necessary rights for the use of the Work as provided in
this License and You must indemnify, defend, and hold harmless OOLC and its directors, officers, employees
and agents from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, actions, causes of action, costs and expenses
(including legal costs on a solicitor and own client basis) that any of them may sustain, incur, suffer, or be
put to at any time, either before or after the expiration or termination of this License, where the same are
based upon, arise out of or occur, directly or indirectly, by reason of any claim that any use by You of the Work
infringes any copyright, moral right, trademark right, patent, trade secret or other intellectual property right of
such third party. OOLC and its directors, officers, employees and agents are intended third party beneficiaries
of this Section.

Work or offered by an individual involved in the creation of the Work.

or in the future have to the venue of any such action or proceeding, and any claim it may now or in the future
have that any such action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

(c) The International Sales Conventions Act of Ontario and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods will not apply in any way to this License or to the transactions contemplated
by this License or otherwise to create any rights or to impose any duties or obligations on either party to

and released by both parties to this License.

declared or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal for any reason whatsoever including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, a decision by any competent courts, legislation, statutes, bylaws or regulations or
any other requirements having the force of law, then the remainder of this License will remain in full force and
effect as if this License had been executed without the Offending Provision.

the transactions contemplated by this License. The remedies provided to the parties under this License
are cumulative and not exclusive to each other, and any such remedy will not be deemed or construed to
